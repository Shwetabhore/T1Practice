there is a significant gap in the availability and accessibility of study materials for students. Juniors often struggle to find comprehensive and reliable resources, such as notes and presentations,which hampers their academic progress and preparation.
To address this issue, we propose the development of an online platform that facilitates the sharing of college resources between senior and junior students. This platform will serve as a centralized repository where seniors can upload their study materials, and juniors can easily access and download these resources. The goal is to enhance the learning experience, promote academic collaboration, and ensure that all students have equal access to essential study aids.
